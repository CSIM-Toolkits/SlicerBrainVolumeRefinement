This extension is focused to provide brain volume refinement methods on biomedical images. More details could be found in the [wiki page](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Extensions/BrainVolumeRefinement).

The BVeR module that provides the fine tunning of brain volumes from previous brain extracted images are also described in the following paper:
